# Home Type Application


In this project I created 3 types of buildings:
- House
- SummerHouse
- Villa


It was created from 3 houses, villas and summerhouse objects. Methods with returning examples were created
> getHouseList()
> 
> getSummerHouseList()
> 
> getVillaList()

The following methods were written from a service class:

- A method that returns the total prices of houses
- A method that returns the total prices of villas
- The method that returns the total prices of the summerhouses
- Method to return the total price of all types of buildings
- A method that returns the average square meter of houses
- A method that returns the average square meter of villas
- The method that returns the average square meter of the summerhouses
- Method to return the average square meter of buildings of all types
- A method that filters all types of buildings according to the number of rooms and living rooms and returns
